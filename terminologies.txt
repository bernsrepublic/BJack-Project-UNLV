Hit: To hit simply means to take another card. 
An online casino player can continue to hit on any hand valued below 21.

Stand: To stand means to leave your hand as is. A player choosing to stand
will not receive any more cards and is not allowed to change his or her bet 
in any way.

Splitting pairs: If a player is dealt a pair of matching cards, such as 
two 8s or any two face cards, he or she has the option of splitting them into 
two separate hands which will be played independently. Normal betting rules 
apply to these new hands. A bet matching your original must be made to do this.

Splitting a pair of aces is always advisable, as drawing a 10 or any face card 
will result in a 21. 

Doubling down: Doubling down is to increase an online casino playerâ€™s initial 
bet by up to double the original amount (the full amount is not required). 
This is only allowed during the initial two-card hand, before any additional 
cards have been dealt. After a double-down bet has been declared, only one 
additional card is dealt, at which point the player must stand.

Insurance: An insurance bet is allowed if the online casino turns up an ace. 
A player may bet up to half of the amount of his or her original bet as an insurance bet. 
An insurance bet will pay out at odds of 2:1 should the dealer reveal a 10 or face card 
(resulting in Blackjack). This results in the player breaking even for the hand,
